# Meteor-kurento
I have created a demo interview app using Meteorjs and Kurento. Sample 5 interview questions are there.
Once the user clicks on start button, he /she can see see a question which has 
to answered within 3 minutes or else it will disappear. Kurento media server will store the interview in a 
user specified server location. This application is modified from Kurento recording example.
If the application server i.e. Meteor and KMS(Kurento media server) are run on the same location, Nothing has to be changed. 
Else the KMS server address has to be provided in the meteor server part.
